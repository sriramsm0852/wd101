For example, here's an array of three entries and assume the date now is 2021-01-21.

[{ name: "Johny" , date: "2021-01-21T02:53:42+05:30" }, { name: "Sugar" , date: "2021-01-22T02:53:42+05:30" }, { name: "Sun" , date: "2021-01-21T03:53:42+05:30" }]

The function should return: ``` Johny,Sun ```. Please note that the names are separated by a comma without space.
